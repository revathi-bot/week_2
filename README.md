**Power BI Data Transformation and Schema Design for Supply Chain Management**

As part of optimizing data integrity and analytics in Power BI, I performed comprehensive data cleaning and transformation to ensure a high-quality dataset. The key steps undertaken include:

Data Cleaning & Transformation:
      Error Handling: All data inconsistencies, missing values, and type mismatches were identified and resolved, ensuring a 0% error rate.
      Duplicate Removal: Implemented de-duplication techniques across datasets to maintain data uniqueness and consistency.
      Standardization & Formatting: Applied necessary transformations, including data type corrections, column renaming, and normalization for better readability and usability.
Data Modeling & Schema Design:
      Established a Star Schema to optimize query performance and enhance reporting efficiency.
      Created well-structured relationships between key tables:
      Fact Table: Supply Chain (Main Dataset)
Dimension Tables:
      Inventory Table (Product stock and availability)
      Management Table (Operational and process insights)
      Supplier Table (Vendor details and procurement data)
      Implemented a One-to-One Relationship between tables where applicable, ensuring data integrity and efficient filtering.
Impact & Outcome
      Enhanced data reliability and accuracy, allowing for seamless visualization and reporting.
      Optimized schema design improves performance and query efficiency.
      Ensured better traceability and governance of supply chain operations through structured relationships.
